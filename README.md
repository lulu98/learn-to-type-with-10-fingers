## Typing Page
You must type the character that is set in the middle box. The boxes on the left are the last two characters you should have typed, the boxes on the right are the coming two characters. On every click the typing data will update and you hear a clicking sound. After the time is up, you will be led to the typing data evaluation page. The timer starts as soon as you type the first character. At each character you also see what fingers to use.
